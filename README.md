# Frontend Mentor - Art gallery website

![Design preview for the Art gallery website coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this art gallery website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

- [GitHub Pages](https://chkhikvadzeg.github.io/art-gallery/)
